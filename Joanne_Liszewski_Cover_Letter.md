**[Current Date]**

**Hiring Manager**
Prison Fellowship
Remote Position - United States

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my genuine interest in the Junior Front-End Web Developer position at Prison Fellowship. As a follower of Jesus Christ and a developer with a deep passion for using technology to serve others, I am compelled by your mission to restore hope, dignity, and purpose to those impacted by incarceration. Prison Fellowship's Christ-centered approach to justice reform resonates profoundly with my personal faith and professional calling.

**Aligning Faith, Service, and Technology**

For over six years, I served vulnerable populations as a Shelter Coordinator and Housing Advocate, walking alongside individuals experiencing homelessness with dignity and compassion. This experience taught me that the most meaningful work happens at the intersection of service and excellence—a principle I now apply in my development career. Just as I advocated for the overlooked and marginalized in shelter ministry, I am eager to build digital experiences that extend Prison Fellowship's reach, making hope and restoration accessible to those behind bars and their families.

I wholeheartedly affirm Prison Fellowship's Statement of Faith. I believe in the full authority of Scripture, the redemptive work of Jesus Christ, and the transforming power of the Gospel. My relationship with Christ is not merely intellectual assent but an active, daily walk that shapes how I approach my work, relationships, and service. I am committed to supporting Prison Fellowship's ministry through both prayer and technical excellence.

**Technical Qualifications for This Role**

My training through the Persevere Coding Program and current internship at Banyan Labs have equipped me with strong front-end development skills directly applicable to this position:

- **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:** I have hands-on experience building responsive, accessible web interfaces using modern HTML5, CSS3 (including Tailwind and Bootstrap frameworks), and vanilla JavaScript as well as React for dynamic user experiences.

- **UI/UX Implementation:** My portfolio at [j-lportfolio-omega.vercel.app](https://j-lportfolio-omega.vercel.app/) demonstrates my ability to translate design concepts into clean, user-friendly interfaces that prioritize accessibility and performance.

- **Version Control & Collaboration:** I work daily with Git and GitHub, participating in Agile sprints, code reviews, and collaborative development workflows. I understand the importance of clean commits, documentation, and team communication.

- **Willingness to Learn SharePoint & WordPress:** While my primary CMS experience is with custom-built systems, I am eager to learn SharePoint for internal content management and deepen my WordPress skills. I have consistently demonstrated my ability to quickly master new platforms—evidenced by earning 100% grades in AWS Cloud Practitioner Essentials, Python, and Prompt Engineering courses in 2025.

- **SEO, Accessibility, and Performance:** I have foundational knowledge of SEO best practices and am committed to learning more about ADA compliance, technical performance optimization, and analytics-driven testing. I believe accessible technology reflects the Gospel's inclusivity.

**Transferable Strengths from Service Background**

My non-technical experience uniquely prepares me for Prison Fellowship's collaborative, mission-driven environment:

- **Communication Excellence:** As a Call Center Manager supervising remote teams, I honed my ability to communicate clearly, troubleshoot technical issues, and collaborate across time zones—skills essential for working with your Sr. Developer and marketing team.

- **Attention to Detail Under Pressure:** Shelter coordination required meticulous documentation, compliance with strict regulations, and quick escalation of urgent cases—paralleling the precision required in web development and content management.

- **Service-Oriented Mindset:** I approach development not as a purely technical exercise but as an act of service. Every line of code, every optimized page load, and every accessible feature is an opportunity to serve your ministry's mission and the people it serves.

**Why Prison Fellowship?**

I am drawn to Prison Fellowship not only because of the mission but because of the methodology: encountering Jesus with those behind bars, breaking cycles, and anticipating revival. This is not generic charity; this is Kingdom work. I want to contribute my skills to ensuring that your digital properties—websites, SharePoint intranet, and content platforms—are as excellent, accessible, and effective as the ministry itself.

I am excited about the opportunity to maintain and update your website, support UI/UX implementation, troubleshoot technical issues, and generate reports that help your team make data-informed decisions. I am ready to pray for this ministry, learn from your Sr. Developer, and grow as both a developer and a servant of Christ.

Thank you for considering my application. I would be honored to discuss how my faith, technical skills, and service background can support Prison Fellowship's life-changing work. I am available for an interview at your convenience and can be reached at 480.310.9874 or joanneliszewski@gmail.com.

In Christ,

**Joanne Liszewski**
